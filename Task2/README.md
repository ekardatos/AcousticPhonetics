# Introduction
This task focuses on the phonetic analysis of speech samples from individuals who have experienced traumatic brain injuries and have been diagnosed with dysarthria. The audio recordings are located in the "audio_files" folder and represent the patients' speech before and after speech therapy.


Objectives
Select one pair of sentences from either A or B, and one pair from C or D.
Segment and phonetically transcribe the utterances.
Analyze the spectrogram and pitch contour.
Calculate and record rhythmic characteristics.
Compare and draw conclusions about the acoustic pitch contour and rhythmic characteristics before and after speech therapy.
Guidelines
Sentence Pair Selection: Choose one pair of sentences from either group A or B, and one pair from group C or D.
Segmentation and Phonetic Transcription: Use Praat to segment utterances into words, syllables, and phonemes and transcribe them phonetically.
Spectrogram and Pitch Contour Analysis:
Use Praat to create spectrograms and copy pitch contours.
Alternatively, use another image editing software or copy-paste the graphs.
Rhythm Characteristic Calculation: Calculate and record articulation rate, speech rate, and pause-to-speech time ratio.
Conclusions: Draw conclusions about the acoustic pitch contour and rhythmic characteristics before and after speech therapy (5-8 lines per pair).
Notes
Focus on comparing one "before" and one "after" speech therapy pair.
Provide clear and comprehensive phonetic analysis supported by graphs and tables.
Base conclusions on the analysis and interpret changes in speech after speech therapy.
Resources
"Recordings" folder containing patient audio recordings.
Praat: free phonetic analysis software.
Phonetic analysis of dysarthric speech before and after speech therapy provides valuable information about the therapy's impact on speech.

This project aims to practice phonetic analysis skills and interpret the results to understand changes related to speech therapy.
